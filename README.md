# VT C++ Serializer/Deserializer Library

This is a simple implementation for easy serialization of `struct`/`packed_struct` of data 
without having user managing heap (dynamic) memory.

User has to beware of platform and microcontroller difference between transmitter and receiver. 
This is just a basic tool for ease of use.
